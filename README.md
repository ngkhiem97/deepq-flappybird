Get ready to witness a stunning example of machine learning in action! Here, in this repository, you'll find an awe-inspiring Python implementation of a Deep Q Network â€“ a reinforcement learning policy that uses a powerful deep neural network to train an agent. And the cherry on top? This well-trained agent has mastered the iconic 2013 mobile game Flappy Bird! Yes, you read that right! By leveraging its exceptional decision-making skills, this agent is able to expertly navigate the game's tricky obstacles by deciding whether to press the command or not. So, if you're a fan of Flappy Bird or just want to see the amazing capabilities of machine learning, you simply can't afford to miss this!

Deep Q Networks (DQNs) are a type of artificial neural network that combines the power of deep learning with the principles of Q-learning. At their core, DQNs are designed to approximate the optimal Q-function, which is a mathematical formula used to evaluate the expected reward of taking a particular action in a given state. In traditional Q-learning, the Q-function is represented as a table that stores the expected reward for every possible combination of state and action. However, this approach quickly becomes impractical when dealing with high-dimensional state spaces or continuous action spaces, which are common in real-world scenarios. This is where DQNs come in. Instead of representing the Q-function as a table, they use a neural network to approximate it. This neural network takes in the current state as input and produces a set of Q-values for each possible action. The action with the highest Q-value is then selected as the optimal action.

Please see below the procedure on how to run the Python program to train the agent as well as how to run the demonstration of the network playing the video game.
