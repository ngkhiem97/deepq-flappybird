This repository has the Python implemetation of a Deep Q Network which is a reinforcement policy to train an agent with deep neural network.The resulted agent is able to play the famous 2013 mobile game Flappy Bird by deciding between pressing the command or not. Please see below the procedure on how to run the Python program to train the agent as well as how to run the demonstration of the network playing the video game.

Here is the demonstration result of the agent playing the 2013 Flappy Bird game.
